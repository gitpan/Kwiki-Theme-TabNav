NAME
    Kwiki::Theme::TabNav - A simple kwiki theme that looks beest using
    Kwiki::Toolbar::List

SYNOPSIS
         $ cpan Kwiki::Theme::TabNav
         $ cd /path/to/kwiki
         $ kwiki -remove Kwiki::Theme::MyCurrentTheme
         $ kwiki -add Kwiki::Theme::TabNav

DESCRIPTION
    A simple, minimalistic theme that provides a different look and feel to
    a kwiki site.

    This theme can be used with Kwiki::Toolbar, but looks better when used
    with Kwiki::Toolbar::List.

    Note that when using Kwiki::Icons::Gnome, the tabs will be offset
    slightly in IE - in firefox it looks fine. Also, it looks like
    Kwiki::Revisions places uses the pipe delimiter somewhere in that code.
